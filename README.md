My lilipond scores for SATB (mostly) vocal a capella groups.

Most of them are arrangements made by me for the coctail parties at our MSU choir. Some are just re-engraved. Some are work-in-progress.

You will need GNU LilyPond to compile a score into PDF file. Please see http://www.lilypond.org/

Compiled files available at http://shulyaka.github.io/scores/
